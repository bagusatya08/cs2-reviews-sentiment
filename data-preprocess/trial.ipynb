       "786  This game used to be great, the fun core gameplay with competitive and casual 6v6 (or 5v5 can't remember) gameplay that left the rounds short and fun but now it has devolved into 16v16 casual games and boring competitive gameplay where you rather leave and take the temporary ban than finish the match. The game lacks the charms it used to have with a flourishing community server page and has left it with boring bland surf or jailbreak servers with high ping that will kick you for basically anything or kill you constantly making you spectate each round in hopes you play the next. Where are TTT servers? where is the fun? I truly believe the only reason people play this game is because they spent too much money on keys hoping to get a cool skin that they feel obligated to get their money's worth out of the game, Quite sad what this game has turned into.   \n",

       "786  This game used to be great, the fun core gameplay with competitive and casual 6v6 (or 5v5 can't remember) gameplay that left the rounds short and fun but now it has devolved into 16v16 casual games and boring competitive gameplay where you rather leave and take the temporary ban than finish the match. The game lacks the charms it used to have with a flourishing community server page and has left it with boring bland surf or jailbreak servers with high ping that will kick you for basically anything or kill you constantly making you spectate each round in hopes you play the next. Where are TTT servers? where is the fun? I truly believe the only reason people play this game is because they spent too much money on keys hoping to get a cool skin that they feel obligated to get their money's worth out of the game, Quite sad what this game has turned into.   \n",
