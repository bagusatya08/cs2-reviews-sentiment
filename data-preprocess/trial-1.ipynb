       "497  Hello Valve,\\n\\nThere are a lot of players with recent profile created that are cheating ( find a workaround for people who are making new accounts only to cheat not risking anything but an e-mail at most ) - maybe you will improve your VAC system. I mean.. it is impossible to play at this time, everything is pretty cool, skins, functionality etc but dude ..at least bring some admins who can stay spectators in games if your system is not capable of protecting the legit and correct players.\\nAlways cheaters with AIM and WALL and you don't do nothing about it.. totally disappointed until your fix..   \n",
